  <br><br>
  <p class="information">Taylor Annart is an artist who uses bridal wear as her canvas and believes that nothing is more
    beautiful than showing your true colours.
    She creates each of her works so that you can feel like a bride without giving up on feeling like yourself.
    <br><br>
    Making art for a living was a lifelong goal of Taylors and after years of attempts and failures,
    getting engaged was what became the moment that launched her art career. So far unable to make it as an artist
    full-time,
    Taylor switched her efforts to pouring out her soul and creativity into her wedding day.
    As someone who wears their heart on their sleeve, and sees the world with 100x saturation,
    Taylor added colour to her hair, her dress, and speckled it all over the venue with handmade flowers and
    centerpieces.
    Bridal but colourful, traditional yet unique, bold but elegant, the dyed wedding dress made a perfect fit for her.
    <br><br>
    Post wedding and low on savings, Taylor was running out of hope for her art career.
    She considered selling her wedding dress, but then thought who would buy a painted dress? It was September 4th,
    2016,
    when suddenly a UK gossip blog posted a picture of Taylor in her painted dress and skyrocketed into viral wedding
    madness.
    Some loved it, some hated it, and hundreds searched for Taylor to become clients. All she could say was yes.
    <br><br>
    Since then, Taylors life has taken quite a few twists and turns, but her business <i>Canvas Bridal</i> has stayed
    and evolved with her.
    From married to divorced, from city to city, and from custom pieces to up-cycling one of a kind gowns.

      <p>With sunset colours: purple, red, orange, and yellow; this painted lace almost glows, mimicking the sun that
        just slips behind the horizon line at sunset.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>This started as an experiment. Taylor sought to create 3D details that could be painted on to enhance the lace,
        and the results were better than she had hoped. The paint and additive mix turned out to be thick, strong, and
        flexible. She envisioned this effortless, easy-to-move-in dress for an adventurous bride. Coloured with deep
        green, aqua, and teal ombre, then hand-painted florals, like a lake speckled with pink flowers floating on top.
        This is a wedding dress you can live in, swim in, hike, ski, and have fun in, and the dark ombre will hide all
        the mess you pick up along the way.</p>

      <p><i>Bust 41” Waist 33” Hip 44” Waist to Floor 46”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>The instant she saw this dress, Taylor knew she wanted to give that show-stopping lace hem an extra punch of
        detail. Inspired by Mandala dot paintings, she started with a vintage/muted sunset ombre colouring then dotted a
        slightly 3D Teal paint on each diamond and around the whole gown. Lastly, to tie this to the top she added dot
        lace to the straps.</p>
      <hr>

      <p><i>Bust 41” Waist 33” Hip 44” Waist to Floor 46”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>A lover of chiffon skirts so flowy, paired with the illusion lace top; Taylor knew this had to be an
        ocean-themed gown. Teal, Aqua, and Deep Blue Ombre. Extra smooth; one of the smoothest gradients she's done.
        It’s perfect. She then hand-beaded the lace top. This was to hide the cups better while adding glam. Pearls, of
        course, and teal glass beads that reminded Taylor of sea glass. Lastly, she saw the opportunity to use this
        fantastic handmade glass bridal button; it’s stunning and the perfect addition to this gown’s keyhole back.</p>

      <p><i>Bust 43” Waist 35” Hip 46” Waist to Floor 46”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>This is Taylor's famous signature sunset colouring with the heat turned up. Fiery glowing yellow and orange
        colors bleed into a crimson red, then a vibrant purple and deep navy blue. Adorned with beadwork and sequins
        that catch the light, Scorch is both elegant and edgy. Illusion button back, sexy sweetheart neckline, lined
        with beads, and built fully structured, this original Maggie Sorttero gown is a timeless classic paired with
        show-stopping colors.</p>

      <p><i>Bust 35” Waist 26” Hip 37” Waist to Floor 45”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Taylor saw the layers of this dress falling like waves on the beach, and it got her dreaming of seashells and
        mermaid vibes. She took the colors from an abalone shell, the pastel color incidence, and glitter shine, and
        then followed that with the gold on the crushed organza to mimic the sand and blues on the smooth organza to
        mimic the ocean.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="l">Features:<br><br>• 2 Types of Organza Layers<br><br>• Covered in Glitter<br><br>• Each Layer is

      <p><i>Bust 39” Waist 31” Hip 42” Waist to Floor 46”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Taylor painted this dress a vibrant tropical color scheme to match the fun and bold lace pattern. A lilac
        purple fades into hot neon pink, then swoops into deep teal blues with patches of orange, yellow, and lime green
        flowing through and highlighting the lace pattern. Beautiful to start, this gown features an illusion keyhole
        open back, removable padding, a lightweight build, and stunning scalloped edge lace.</p>

      <h1>Fairy Dust</h1>
      <p><i>Bust 41” Waist 33” Hip 44” Waist to Floor 45”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Once she saw that glitter pattern, Taylor knew she wanted to do another gown for her Prism collection. This one
        was inspired by the light fairytale feeling of fairy dust transforming and swirling around. It’s the
        lighthearted sister to the Enchanted dress. This is an airy gown with a fun leg slit. Beautiful illusion button
        back, Illusion deep vee neck, light removable padding, and boning for structure. Originally a Rebecca Ingram
        gown, size 14. Jewels have been added on the Illusion tulle, rhinestone buttons, and all the swirling color.</p>

      <p><i>Bust 43” Waist 35” Hip 46” Waist to Floor 48”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>This dress is silvery baby blue that features a vertical ombre coloring that touches the waist. Covered in
        glitter and jewels from the start, Taylor coloured this dress in teal, deep blue, purple, and magenta tones like
        a bright star in the galaxy. The teal reaches the highest on the back right side, and the colour swoops down to
        magenta with a subtle cloudy swirl.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>These photos do not do this dress justice; it is STUNNING. All the right hits of vintage boho flair on a
        well-made gown. This is an Abella by Allure E106 gown in a champagne cream tone that fades into a coloring of
        peach, muted pink, and purple, then a vibrant teal. The back lace is see-through, what we call an illusion lace
        back. Taylor's favorite part of this gown, is the massive train. The layers are so lush and full that you
        instantly feel like a princess in this dress with miles of fabric to play in.</p>

      <p><i>Bust 43” Waist 35” Hip 46” Waist to Floor 47”</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p>The colouring of this dress was inspired by what Taylor calls "cotton-candy clouds at dusk", and funny enough,
        this dress at dusk is just so dreamy. The colours blend so smoothly. It’s a timeless dress with a playful but
        romantic coloring. This is a Rebecca Ingram gown called Summer in a rose cream tone that fades into Taylor's
        coloring of pink, muted purple, and then a vibrant, rich blue.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>When restoring this Casablanca Bridal Designer gown, Taylor was instantly inspired to accent the luxurious,
        sparkly jeweled bodice with the colours of the aurora borealis swirling around the cascading layers of tulle.
        She pictured the night sky, stars, and the northern lights in one stunning, glamorous, modern bridal gown.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>This dress has been 100% manufactured and handcrafted in the USA.
        The original designer, Jude Jowilson, created all their gowns this way. New, this dress would have sold for
        around $4000 without colouring. This is a very high-quality gown Taylor acquired in perfect condition and
        coloured in her classic and signature sunset coloring. What she loves about this gown is its very unique ability
        to switch from a full bridal gown into a mini dress just by un-snapping the skirt portion.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>This dress instantly gives royal vibes; its base is a cream color with gold highlights woven into the bold lace
        pattern. Taylor pictured herself running through an abandoned castle in the woods. Fantasy and fairytales
        inspired this magical colouring, swirling metallic blue and purple, with a touch of pink, copper, and gold
        accents. The colours dance around, sparking like a spell has just been cast.</p>
